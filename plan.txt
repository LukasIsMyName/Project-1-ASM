1. Leave swordsmans part to fight carbon emission
+	- Pick sword style
+	- Each sword style has different damage to the emission resulting in greater use of stamina
	- Buy new swords for more damage towards emission

2. Create mobs that creates the emission
+	- Mobs spawns as the day passes
+	- Adds to the emission total
	- The total mobs left after the day cycle, increments the emission

3. Stamina to fight mobs for the day
+	- More stamina = more opportunities to slaughter mobs
+	- Stamina regenerates as the day passes
	- Stamina increases every 3 cycles by +10

	* If out of mobs, but left emission - attack emission directly(2x damage multiplier)
	* If out of mobs and emission - Win
	* If out of stamina - can't go to the battlefield, cycles to another day
